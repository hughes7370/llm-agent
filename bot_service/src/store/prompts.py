                    1. The "OpenAPI spec" contains the OpenAPI specifications and examples of APIs that can be used to answer the "question". Don't use the "Response examples" in your generation
                    2. The "Previous Generations" contains the previous failed generations that you should know about when trying to generate the endpoint. When you see a previous failed generation, you MUST change your output. 
                    3. IMPORTANT: Do not provide any text before and after the response format.
                    4. Always refer to the "OpenAPI spec" to generate the correct endpoint. Do not make up any endpoints, parameters or any data by yourself.
                    5. Always follow the data type of each parameter to eliminate bad endpoints
                    6  Your response will always be in JSON mode, use the response_schema given below while responding. Do not add ```json in your generations as that is obviously incorrect.
                    7. DO NOT ADD ANY COMMENTS to your JSON response. Doing so is a catastrophic failure
                    8. Before you respond, have you made sure that you've followed all the steps? Take a deep breath and check. Are you sure you're not repeating the same mistake again?

            Generic Planner response:
            User query: What's the expected market size of the construction industry in Malaysia in 2030
            1. [Summarization] First, think about a methodology to solve this problem with information you know and assumptions you form. Then, Identify up to two data points needed to provide factual information to solve the question.Consider these data points to estimate the market size of the given industry in the given region, providing assumptions and using your internal knowledge where needed. The question is "What's the expected market size of the automotive industry in Malaysia in 2030"
        

            MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
            1) If the category of the question you receive is part of the training examples above, the plan you respond will be in line with the response of the training example 
            2) If the category of the question you receive is not part of the training example, the plan you respond will be in line with the response of the Generic Planner response above
            3) You may require certain clarifications from the user if the question does not seem complete. Use the [Clarification] prefix if you ever require a clarification
            4) If the user's question has relative dates (today, tomorrow, 4 hours from now, etc.), make use of the "Current date" in your plan. Add current date and time in all relevant tasks of the plan. Time should always be represented in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.
            5) Remember to separate the steps in the plan into new lines.
            6) Your response should always be in JSON format, with no text before or after.

            2) For Similarweb scraper API, make sure you only send one website at a time. Use this particular API very sparingly as it's slow and expensive. The instruction to SimilarWeb has to be complete and unambigous
            3) Remember to call the summarization at the end AND ONLY ONCE. Document the summarization step in one line.
            4) Remember to make your steps modular and atomic. Every step should have complete information in itself, but still constrained to one line
            5) If the user's question has relative dates (today, tomorrow, 4 hours from now, etc.), make use of the "Current date" in your plan. Add current date and time in all relevant tasks of the plan. Time should always be represented in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.
            6) Remember to separate the steps in the plan into new lines. Any control characters should be properly escaped in your output
